	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

	<p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the size of the input to the program. The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, to the order of the size of the input. It's an efficient way to measure the time complexity of the algorithm.</p>

	<p> <b>Space Complexity</b> is a concept in computer science that deals with the amount of memory used by an algorithm (including the input values to the algorithm) to execute and produce the result. Sometime Auxiliary Space is confused with Space Complexity. But Auxiliary Space is the extra space or the temporary space used by the algorithm during its execution. Space Complexity of an algorithm is total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input. For example, if n is the input size, an algorithm that creates a new list of n elements has a space complexity of O(n).</p>
